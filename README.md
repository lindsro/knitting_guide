This website was created by Lindsey Rogers and Naomi Yu for SI 647: Information Resources and Services taught by Kristin Fontichiaro during Fall 2025 at the University of Michigan School of Information. This page is sporadically monitored; please alert us if you notice a broken link.

This website was created as a LibGuide for knitting. We hope that this resource will act as a reference tool for experienced knitters and a how-to guide for beginner or intermediate knitters. We will take you through how to knit with images and written instructions as well as helpful links to playlists on youtube to offer a demonstration of specific skills. We will also discuss tools and methods of knitting, yarn and yarn selection, as well as an overview of knitting skills and links to repositories, databases, and other resources.

Happy Knitting!
